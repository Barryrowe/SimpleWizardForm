This is my first jQuery Plugin.

Wizard Form - This will take a form, and a list of steps, and transform it into a simple wizard, that will allow the user to step back and forth through the steps.  Some simple validation is available by default, and can easily be modified to provide more thorough validation steps.

To view this as a jsFiddle you can visit this URL:  http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.4/Barryrowe/SimpleWizardForm/tree/master/Demo/ 

Feel free to fork this plugin, and improve upon it!

Next TODOs:

1.  Implement proper Modal overlay, disabling key press form submission/navigation.
2.  Expand the default validation support
3.  Provide better default styling
